## 2. Press control-C to exit

## 3. Create the database tables/migrations
$ ./manage.py migrate

## 4. Create the Super User or Admin account with a user name and password.
$ ./manage.py createsuperuser

## 5. Restart the server.
$ . ./k666-env

## 6. Visit the site.
Go to http://localhost:8000/static/index.html ... see an index page!

## 7. Hooray!
